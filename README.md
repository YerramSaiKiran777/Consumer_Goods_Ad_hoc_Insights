# Consumer_Goods_Ad_hoc_Insights

--> This is my Sql project which I have done as a part of the Codebasics Data Analytics bootcamp.
 
---------------
Project objective:
---------------
Atliq Hardwares is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and has expanded it's opeartions in other countries too.

However, in order to make quick and data-driven decisions the management noticed that they do not get enough insights from the data. 

So Tony Sharma, the data analytics director, wanted to hire few junior data analysts for their team who were good at both tech and soft skills. 

Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills of the candidates.

----------
Task given:
----------
1) A pdf with 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs the insights is given and you need to need to run a SQL queries to answer these requests. 
2) The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management, hence you need to create a presentation to show the insights.

----------
Tools used:
----------
MySql,
Power BI,
Microsoft PowerPoint

-----------
My approach:
-----------
Understanding of the business requests and the given data.

Applied the sql concepts like aggregations, group by, window functions, subqueries and CTEs in queries to retrieve the results . 

Imported the results into PowerBI to create visual representation of the results.

Utilized PowerPoint to present my insights on the given requests.


My Insights:
-----------
A **PDF** is attached to this repository that contains the ad-hoc requests, its results obtained using SQL and the visualizations that were created using Power BI and finally my interpretations from the results.
